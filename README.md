# Binary-Search-Tree-and-Recursion
This repository demonstrates how recursion can be used in different ways for traversal through BST.

# Tasks

(a)	Create a Binary Search Tree (BST) from the first letters following list of names: use your first name and the first names of 8 of your friends. 

(b)	Write the algorithm to output this list (from the BST) in alphabetical order.

(c)	Write the algorithm that returns the number of non-leaf nodes in the tree.

(d)	Write the algorithm that outputs the contents of the leaf node with the lowest value.

(e)	Write the algorithm that outputs the median name from the tree.

(f)	Write the algorithm that searches for a given name in the tree. It will return whether the name has been found or not. It will also return the search path used.

Examples: 
Searching for 28 (from root) , would result in      	right, left, left, 28 Found
Searching for 25 (from root) , would result in   	left, right, Not Found
